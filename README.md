# Linked Open Citation Database

## About

LOC-DB is a distributed maintainable database for storage extrapolation of citation metadata.

This page will contain all information necessary to set up a local LOC-DB node, including the [back-end](https://github.com/locdb/loc-db) and the [front-end](https://github.com/locdb/locdb-frend).
Note that both components do not have to be installed on the same machine.
The back-end will hold the data-base and provide a REST interface.
The front-end provides a GUI for the extrapolation of citations.

Check the LOC-DB [blog](https://locdb.bib.uni-mannheim.de/blog/en/) for more information about the associated project.
